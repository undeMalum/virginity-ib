# Virginity across IBDP subjects
This repo contains the code that was used to analyze and visualize data obtained from [the survey posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/12h82os/virginity_across_ibdp_subjects/).

## Results
Results were posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/12r5ogx/virginity_across_ibdp_subjects_results/). CSV files
with analyzed data are located in the `results_csvs` folder. The PDF file with summary charts are located in the `charts` folder.

## Limitation of the investigation
It all began as my math assignment - hence binomial distribution. If you are
interested in what I did, you can go and see [my presentation about this](https://edugespl-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/mateusz_konat_eduges_pl/EVcqCussXTBApsBg9K2nhGoBXO2WlCbhkQD7sgF6WMcvgw?e=cAX0SZ).

However, there is an awful lot of limitation to my investigation and data I obtained. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/12h82os/comment/jfoogwe/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
does a great job explaining to what else I could have looked into to reach more meaningful and insightful conclusions. I talk
about this issue a bit in the above-mentioned presentation.

## Issues
I made too many mistakes while processing data and creating charts... more than I care to admit. You may go to [this instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrNTGOHILXb/)
and compare charts from there with ones currently in the PDF. Not only is the difference about how the chars look like, but
more importantly about what data is displayed. The difference is so plausible that no one was able to spot the mistake.
It took me a lot of time to figure out what's wrong and how to repair it.

Therefore, if you see any problems, **do not hesitate to point them out!!!**
